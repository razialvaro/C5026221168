                <h2>Ninja has Ligma?!?</h2>
                <p><small><small>a celebrity in 2018 is all about access: people want influencers to constantly create new content, or they expect regular fan interaction. The golden YouTube standard is daily uploads, while Twitch streamers broadcast for hours on end. So when Twitch’s biggest Fortnite streamer, Tyler “Ninja” Blevins went offline for some of the day last week, fans wondered if something had happened to him. That’s when a troll stepped in to “explain” the situation.
                    The aptly named Instagram account “Ninja Hater” created a terrible Photoshop that put the Fortnite extraordinaire next to deceased figures such as Michael Jackson and Tupac. It was obviously fake — the appended caption read, “lets make fake news,” meaning that the user wanted people to believe Blevins had died during his brief disappearance. Sure enough, the next day another Instagram account reposted the image and said they couldn’t believe that Blevins had died of ligma. </small></small></p>
